            <h1>MULTIVERSE TF GAME</h1>
            <p>by Hako45</p><br>

            <p>Thank you for checking out my silly little game! <br>All characters belong to respective owners.</p>
            
            <p> You are an intern starting your term at Multiverse Manufacturing, touring the site with your supervisor. <br>
                They leave you alone in front of a machine that summons characters from other universes and transforms them into whatever you want. <br>
                They need to step out, trusting you won't do anything bad. Big mistake.
            </p>
